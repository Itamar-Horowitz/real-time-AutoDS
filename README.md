## AutoDS

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alonsaguy/One-click-image-reconstruction-in-single-molecule-localization-microscopy-via-deep-learning/blob/main/AutoDS/AutoDS_inference_v1_2.ipynb)

This part contains two Jupyter notebooks:
- **Training**: Train your own Deep-STORM model
- **Inference**: Run AutoDS for one-click image reconstruction

> Pre-trained models (4 total) are available in the `models/` directory.
